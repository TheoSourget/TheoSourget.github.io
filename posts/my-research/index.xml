&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the evaluation of models heavily relies on publicly available datasets used as benchmarking. While this could be a nice thing for a fair comparison of different models, we also question the effect of the diversity or more precisely a potential lack of diversity in research papers when selecting the datasets. A gap has been observed between the results showcased by AI models in research and their adoption in clinical workflow, we hypothesise that this gap could partly be a result of an overfitting of research on these datasets and we wanted to evaluate their usage to know if some are more popular than others. While this could seem like a straightforward task we’ll see that because of some elements it turned out to be not so simple.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
