I use them to demonstrate the capacity of a trained model or a pipeline I developed but also use the code in a more general purpose. To build these apps I use a combination of three tools: Streamlit, FastAPI, and Docker. In this post, I first show two examples of applications I&amp;rsquo;ve created, and then I present the tools with some simple examples of code.</description></item><item><title>[Citation needed] Data usage and citation practices in medical imaging conferences​</title><link>https://theosourget.github.io/posts/my-research/citation-needed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theosourget.github.io/posts/my-research/citation-needed/</guid><description>Click on the image below to see my oral session at MIDL 2024:
Nowadays, the evaluation of models heavily relies on publicly available datasets used as benchmarking. While this could be a nice thing for a fair comparison of different models, we also question the effect of the diversity or more precisely a potential lack of diversity in research papers when selecting the datasets. A gap has been observed between the results showcased by AI models in research and their adoption in clinical workflow, we hypothesise that this gap could partly be a result of an overfitting of research on these datasets and we wanted to evaluate their usage to know if some are more popular than others.</description></item></channel></rss>
