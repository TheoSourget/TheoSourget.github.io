# a summary about you
summary: "Passionate about Data Science and AI, I graduated in 2023 with a Master's degree in Data Science at the [Universit√© de Rouen](http://mastersid.univ-rouen.fr/en/index.php). 
During my studies I've specialised myself in Medical Image Analysis with projects focusing on the classification and segmentation of medical images using deep learning models. These projects were also about training transformer models with small datasets and the effect of Data Augmentation and Transfer learning. 
I'm currently a Research Assistant of the [PURRlab](https://purrlab.github.io/) at the IT University of Copenhagen. My research areas are the robustness of AI in healthcare and the study of public medical datasets in research papers."
