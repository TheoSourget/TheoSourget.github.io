# a summary about you
summary: "Passionate about Data Science and AI, I graduated in 2023 with a Master's degree in Data Science at the [Université de Rouen](http://mastersid.univ-rouen.fr/en/index.php). 
During my studies I've specialised myself in Medical Image Analysis with projects focusing on the classification and segmentation of medical images using deep learning models. These projects were also about training transformer models with small datasets and the effect of Data Augmentation and Transfer learning. 
After my Master's degree, I worked as a Research Assistant in [PURRlab at the IT University of Copenagen](https://purrlab.github.io/) and in the [MICS laboratory at CentraleSupélec Paris](https://mics.centralesupelec.fr/) on the robustness of AI in healthcare and the study of public medical datasets in research papers. 
I am now a PhD Student in PURRlab working on the evaluation of machine learning algorithms and data quality."
