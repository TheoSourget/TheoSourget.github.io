# a summary about you
summary: "Passionate about Data Science and AI, I graduated in 2023 with a Master's degree in Data Science at the [Université de Rouen](http://mastersid.univ-rouen.fr/en/index.php). 
During my studies I've specialised myself in Medical Image Analysis with projects focusing on the classification and segmentation of medical images using deep learning models. These projects were also about training transformer models with small datasets and the effect of Data Augmentation and Transfer learning. 
I'm currently a Research Engineer in the [MICS laboratory](https://mics.centralesupelec.fr/) at CentraleSupélec and affiliated to [PURRlab](https://purrlab.github.io/) at the IT University of Copenhagen. 
My research areas are the robustness of AI in healthcare and the study of public medical datasets in research papers."
