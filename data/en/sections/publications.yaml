  paper:
    summary: The U-Net model, introduced in 2015, is established as the state-of-the-art architecture for medical image segmentation, along with its variants UNet++, nnU-Net, V-Net, etc. Vision transformers made a breakthrough in the computer vision world in 2021. Since then, many transformer based architectures or hybrid architectures (combining convolutional blocks and transformer blocks) have been proposed for image segmentation, that are challenging the predominance of U-Net. In this paper, we ask the question whether transformers could overtake U-Net for medical image segmentation. We compare SegFormer, one of the most popular transformer architectures for segmentation, to U-Net using three publicly available medical image datasets that include various modalities and organs with the segmentation of cardiac structures in ultrasound images from the CAMUS challenge, the segmentation of polyp in endoscopy images and the segmentation of instrument in colonoscopy images from the MedAI challenge. We compare them in the light of various metrics (segmentation performance, training time) and show that SegFormer can be a true competitor to U-Net and should be carefully considered for future tasks in medical image segmentation.

  paper:
    summary: In this work, we focused on deep learning image processing in the context of oral rare diseases, which pose challenges due to limited data availability. A crucial step involves teeth detection, segmentation and numbering in panoramic radiographs. To this end, we used a dataset consisting of 156 panoramic radiographs from individuals with rare oral diseases and labeled by experts. We trained the Detection Transformer (DETR) neural network for teeth detection, segmentation, and numbering the 52 teeth classes. In addition, we used data augmentation techniques, including geometric transformations. Finally, we generated new panoramic images using inpainting techniques with stable diffusion, by removing teeth from a panoramic radiograph and integrating teeth into it. The results showed a mAP exceeding 0,69 for DETR without data augmentation. The mAP was improved to 0,82 when data augmentation techniques are used. Furthermore, we observed promising performances when using new panoramic radiographs generated with inpainting technique, with mAP of 0,76.
